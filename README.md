# First Exploration 
* LIST OF ALL PDFs IN THE FIRST SAMPLE WITH A PATTERN OF BIG NUMBER AND SMALL NUMBER ON THE UP-RIGHT CORNER. 

* All filenames are in the form of UCD_Lehmann_0000.jpg

* I represented words and numbers according to their position for the convinience of viewing if words are correcly catched by pdf parser engine. *one example is put in ./notes*

## 0208
Nothing
words are not displayed horizontally.

## 0628
* target is at the bottom-right corner

$165.00 as 's' '165' '00'
's' and '00' are a little bit higher than '165' but they have the same size.
